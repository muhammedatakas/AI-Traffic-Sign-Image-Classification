### Load Data Function

In the `load_data` function, I have resized the images of traffic signs and returned a tuple containing the data as images (numpy array) and labels (integer values).

### Get Model Method

In the `get_model` method, I created a sequential neural network with an input shape of 30x30 with 3 RGB color channels. Initially, I added a convolutional layer with 32 filters followed by max pooling. This setup, along with a dense layer with 32 units, provided a good amount of accuracy.

However, I aimed to increase the accuracy to over 90%. During experimentation, I found that adding a convolutional layer with 64 filters after pooling led to overfitting. To address this, I increased the number of units in the dense layer and adjusted the dropout rate, but these changes did not improve the performance.

I then discovered the `BatchNormalization` method and applied it after the dense layer, which had a positive effect. Eventually, I realized that batch normalization should be applied after each layer. By doing so, the accuracy increased significantly, rising from around 70% to between 90% and 98%.
